# Hints for Data Structures

* 1 1.2 Describe what it means for two strings to be permutations of each other. Now, look at that definition you provided.  Can you check the strings against that definition?

* 2 3.1 A stack is simply a data structure in which the most recently added elements are removed first.  Can you simulate a single stack using an array?  Remember that there are many possible solutions, and there are tradeoffs of each.

* 3 2.4 There are many solutino to this problem, most of which are equally optimal in runtime.  Some have shorter, cleaner code than others.  Can you brainstorm different solutions?
